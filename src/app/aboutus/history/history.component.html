                <span>Buildmate Specialist Products Limited was founded by a Ghanaian family called
                        Nuako, in Ghana. It was called Bizzel Enterprise in its early stages of business in 2008.
                        The main objective of the business then, was importing paint from Thailand.
                        However, Influenced by the nature of the construction industry in the country, the
                        company saw an opportunity window to move into the trend of building construction
                        material. The company realized that customers needed other things beyond the scope of
                        paints, therefore decided to go into building chemicals like sealant, water proofing, add
                        mixtures, bonding agents, special mortars amongst others.</span>
