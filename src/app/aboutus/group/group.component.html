                            Compound, in 2008. Geo-Fix Paving Jointing Compound offers a number of benefits over cement based
                            mortars as it is easy to point up, there’s no cement stains, it sets hard and it won’t crack or wash
                            out. Geo-Fix is easily finished by compacting with a pointing tool saving valuable time compared to
                            traditional wet pointing. Geo-Fix offers huge time saving benefits compared to applying traditional
                            mortar. The ready to use formula is so easy to use and even stops weed growth. Available in a variety of
                            pack sizes.</div>
